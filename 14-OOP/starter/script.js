////////////////////////////////////
// Coding Challenge #1
// Your tasks:
// 1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a  'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in  km/h
// 2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,  and log the new speed to the console
// 3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log  the new speed to the console
// 4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and  'brake' multiple times on each of them
// Test data:
// § Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
// § Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
// GOOD LUCK 😀

////////////////////////////////////
// Coding Challenge #2
// Your tasks:
// 1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
// 2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide  by 1.6)
// 3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but  converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
// 4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'  methods, and with the getter and setter.
// Test data:
// § Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
// GOOD LUCK 😀

////////////////////////////////////
// Coding Challenge #3
// Your tasks:
// 1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called 'EV') as a child  "class" of 'Car'. Besides a make and current speed, the 'EV' also has the  current battery charge in % ('charge' property)
// 2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument  'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo'
// 3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20,  and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140  km/h, with a charge of 22%'
// 4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate',  'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when  you 'accelerate'! Hint: Review the definiton of polymorphism 😉
// Test data:
// § Data car 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%
// GOOD LUCK 😀

////////////////////////////////////
// Coding Challenge #4
// Your tasks:
// 1. Re-create Challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl' child class of the 'CarCl' class
// 2. Make the 'charge' property private
// 3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery' methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl' class. Then experiment with chaining!
// Test data:
// § Data car 1: 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%
// GOOD LUCK 😀
